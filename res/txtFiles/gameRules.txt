     Seven cards are dealt to each player and for each pair a player has, their score is incremented by one. On your turn you are able to ask one other player if they have a matching card to one in your hand. If the player asked does indeed have the card they must relenquish it to you. The pair is then removed and added to your total score. You may then inquire, to the same player or to a different player, if they have another card you need to make a pair. This continues until you are told "Go Fish!" You then draw a card from the deck and moving clockwise, it's the next player's turn. This sequence continues unill all pairs have been played.The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins!
