     In the beginning of the game it's your turn, which is indicated by the yellow border around your cards. At any point in the game you will be able to tell whose turn it is by the yellow border. First remove any pairs from your hand by clicking on the cards. Then click the button to advance until it is your turn again. You may then continue with normal game play and ask a player for a card. All you have to do is click on a card and click another player's hand. You can continue to do so until you are told "Go Fish!" Once told so you must click the deck and then advance the turns. If you ever run out of cards just click the deck for a refill. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins! Good Luck!
